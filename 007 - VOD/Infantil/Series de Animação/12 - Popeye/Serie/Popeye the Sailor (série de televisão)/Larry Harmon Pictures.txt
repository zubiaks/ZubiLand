<info>Popeye and Olive travel to Mexico, where the latter gets the urge to see a bullfight after seeing the "world's greatest bullfighter" (El Diablo) on a poster, much to Popeye's disgust as it goes against his code of "being kinds to defenksless aminals". Once inside, both are shocked to see that El Diablo's opponent is just a defenseless young bull. The now angered sailor enters the ring and confronts El Diablo, but not before giving the calf to Olive. As their fight begins, El Diablo takes out a dagger and uses it to de-pant Popeye and, with his opponent distracted by embarrassment, send him flying through a nearby wall. The newly-made hole turns out to lead into the bullpen, which causes a rampaging adult bull to break out and chase after El Diablo. The unchivalrous Diablo then uses Olive as his muleta, which makes the distressed Olive call out for Popeye. As Popeye runs in to save her, he is sent flying and onto a pole by a swift blow from the agressive bull. Popeye then quickly regains his footing by eating his trusty can of spinach and proceeds to "grab the bull by the horns", turning it into a platter of tasty steaks, which he then uses to knock El Diablo out via multi-layered meaty punch. With matters finally resolved, Popeye receives a kiss from the grateful calf.</info></item>

After the robot spots Olive via a screen, he captures her, and Popeye sets out to rescue his girlfriend: he lassoes up to the flying saucer to try and get Olive back. Meeting the robot, Popeye demands the return of Olive Oyl, which at first makes the robot think Popeye was asking for motor oil, and he squirts some at him, but Popeye specifically tells the robot that he wants his girlfriend back.

<info>Popeye and Olive visit her uncle Sylvan Oyl, who is a big-game hunter and has a large collection of exotic beasts for display at the Explorer's Club. However, Popeye and Olive notice a giant display case that remains empty. Sylvan then explains that he intends to use that display for the rarest creature of all, the yeti, better known as the Abominable Snowman, but then explains that no ordinary man can catch it. Popeye is intrigued by the challenge and decides to help Sylvan catch the legendary beast, so the trio travel to Mt. Idiot in the Himalayas (such named because the mountain can never make correct echos). The trio soon spot the yeti in the distance and Popeye goes after it, only to fall into an icy underground cavern. He then finds himself surrounded by gigantic yetis which he tries to punch out, but his attacks are completely ineffective and cause a mass of icicles to fall on him.</info></item>
