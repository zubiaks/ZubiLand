<info>After months of searching, Popeye (accompanied by Swee'Pea and Olive Oyl, although they only appear in the beginning) brings his ship to Goona Island (not to be confused with Goon Island) where his quest for his long-lost father has led him. Sure enough, Pappy is there, and uses a spyglass to check on the "intruder" that has come to his island. He then releases a large gorilla-like beast from a huge cage, which soon snatches Popeye up, but is left cold by a punch from the sailor protagonist. Poopdeck then calls upon "Charlie", a giant black octopus, to take care of the invader, yet a big puff of smoke from Popeye's pipe leaves the animal devoid of strength. The two tough sailors finally meet, with Popeye insisting that they are father and child, but Pappy says his son "looks like something the dogs digged up", also employing his catchphrase, "I hates relatives". Pappy tests the newcomer by punching him, but their argument is interrupted by the appearance of the sea monster that often terrorized the island. It promptly grabs Popeye, whose spinach can falls off, but Pappy catches it and gulps the vegetable down, soon beating the beast and rescuing his son. With Popeye's preference for spinach as evidence that they are father and son, they finally reconcile.</info></item>

<info>Popeye and Olive are summoned to Spinachia by their old friend King Blozo who is in dire need of the sailor's might after his kingdom started being invaded by a daily barrage of non-explosive missiles. Upon arriving at the royal castle and reuniting with King Blozo, a strange taxi-missile appears before them and they ride the mysterious warhead to a place called Missile City (apparently a recently founded location as King Blozo believes that it must be one of the new developments). Missile City is then revealed to be a kingdom inhabited by living humanoid missile-people and where everything moves at 2000 miles per hour. The taxi-missile then drops them off at the Missile Palace where they are met by the Mad Leader of Missile City (who is unaware that they are from the country they're invading). He then offers them a tour of his kingdom by his Vice-Missile, who then happily shows them around. The trio enjoy the sights until the Vice-Missile shows them the kingdom's giant warheads to be used in the final assault on Spinachia. King Blozo then reveals who he is and that he will not allow his kingdom to be destroyed. However, his proud declaration only angers the Vice-Missile who then has the guards throw them in jail. The Mad Leader then explains to his prisoners that they need to invade Spinachia for its bountiful fields of spinach, as spinach is the main source of energy for the missile-people due to its high iron content and they are in desperate need of it as their country only has one can of spinach left. The Mad Leader then leads his army into battle, and leaves the trio locked up so as not to interfere. Popeye then desperately tries to reach for the last can of spinach but he is unable to reach it from his cell. Luckily, Olive's long limbs help her reach the valued spinach which Popeye quickly consumes, giving him the strength and speed of a missile himself. Now flying at full speed, Popeye KOs all the missiles in his way and then confronts the Mad Leader, knocking him out instantly. The now calmed and weakened Mad Leader regrets his actions but says that his people desperately needed the spinach. Popeye then gives the pitiful Mad Leader the last of his spinach, thus saving his life. The now grateful Mad Leader is indebted to the compassionate sailor and asks what he can do to repay him. Popeye then asks of the Mad Leader to never invade kingdoms again and that he will even teach him and his people how to grow their own spinach, much to their joy.</info></item>

<info>Popeye and Olive Oyl are walking around the street, looking for a birthday present for her. Olive sees a fur coat, but Popeye says it is one of those phony furs that fall apart when worn. Olive takes notice of a pearl necklace and they enter the store, however, they are shocked that the necklace costs a lot of money. Instead, they take to the seas to find pearls to make their own necklace. Popeye dives into the water, and collects pearls. However, the Sea Hag warns Popeye to get out, since the pearls belong to her. She orders her dogfish to chase him, but the sailor calls a catfish to scare away the dogfish. Popeye collects more pearls, but is chased by several swordfish. Olive then eats some spinach and strikes the Sea Hag down the ocean floor. Popeye stops the swordfish with electric eels. He finds Olive stuck in the hole she made while punching the Sea Hag so hard, she must be halfway to China. Popeye gives Olive a pearl necklace of his own making, saying "happy birthday!"</info></item>

<info>The story begins at the carnival, where Popeye and Olive Oyl are going through the Tunnel of Love. When Olive spots a pile of plastic treasures and other valuables within the tunnel's romantic decor, she wishes they were real so she could go on a real treasure hunt for riches. Just then, Bernice the Wiffle Bird appears after overhearing Olive and tells her that she can grant her wish thanks to several cosmic forces being properly aligned with the tunnel. Olive happily asks her to do so, and then watches as the Wiffle Bird transforms the tunnel into a magical realm of enchanted treasures and adventure. The now giddy Olive and Popeye begin to collect buckets worth of treasure, but before they can leave with their loot the Wiffle Bird warns them that there are "Three Dangerous Dangers" that they must face if they wish to leave with their gold. Popeye then realizes that their lives are more valuable than treasure and tries to convince Olive to leave the loot behind, but having apparently contracted a case of gold fever, Olive refuses and moves forward into the dangers ahead. The first danger is a hall of crushing boulders that almost flattens the couple but only manages to pinch Olive's dress. The second danger is none other than the legendary gorgon Medusa, who turns Olive to stone, but Popeye is able to trick her into going to a beauty parlor. With her out of range, her stone magic wears off and Olive returns to normal. The third danger is the lovely but dangerous Siren, who once lured sailors to their doom by enchanting them with her beauty. The same fate almost befalls Popeye as he could not resist her beauty, but Olive quickly takes Popeye's spinach can from his pocket and uses her newfound strength to knock out the "hussy" Siren to next Tuesday, which instantly frees Popeye from her spell. With all the dangers passed, the couple finally reach the exit but when they leave, their treasure turns into ordinary pictures of treasure. The Wiffle Bird then returns and informs them that she forgot to tell them that the spell she used to bring the tunnel to life wears off when exposed to daylight, much to Olive's frustration. Popeye then reminds us all that it does not pay to be greedy before tooting his signature pipe.</info></item>

<info>The story begins in the Rough House Cafe, where Popeye refuses to let Wimpy mooch him again. As a dejected and hungry Wimpy wanders the park, he spots a "tasty-looking" bird and hopes to make a hamburger out of it. He soon finds out that the bird is none other than Bernice the Wiffle Bird who in anger curses Wimpy, making it so that whenever Wimpy hears or says the word "hamburger", he will transform into a vicious werewolf. After the Wiffle Bird flies off, a confused Wimpy utters the cursed word and is instantly changed into a hulking wolf-man who then goes on a rampage. Word quickly spreads through town, even appearing in the news. Back at the Rough House Cafe, Rough House and Popeye hear the news report of the mysterious werewolf's attacks. Suddenly, the cafe is attacked by none other than the werewolf, who Popeye quickly pursues. After chasing the beast to the park, he finds Wimpy (who has transformed back due to consuming a burger). Popeye then enquires to the location of the werewolf but Wimpy explains to him that he was the werewolf all along, and about the curse every time he says "hamburger", which transforms him back into the wolf much to Popeye's shock. After escaping from the transformed Wimpy, Popeye runs into Bernice, who tells him what Wimpy did. Popeye then begs Bernice to undo the curse, and she accepts, but only if Popeye can hold the beast still. Popeye then peruses his trusty can of spinach and knocks out Wimpy, allowing Bernice to undo her spell. With things back to normal, Wimpy once again tries to mooch Popeye, but the sailor cuts him off before he can say the name of his favorite snack, just in case the spell has not yet completely worn off.</info></item>
